on-load
The CDCL algorithm finds a satisfying solution to a propositional formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) if one exists. First enter clauses
into the clause database.


on-send-db
First the algorithm will propogate any decisions. For instance, if a unit clause exists, we know the value of that literal.

user-decision
This literal is added to the graph, and the decision is propogated. Nodes indicate the literal, its level, and (if it is not a decision node)
the clause in which it was propogated. A propogated node is pointed to by all other nodes in its corresponding clause.
If it has been propogated but the database is not satisfied, the algorithm asks the user for an arbitrary assignment of a literal.
