IF TIME
let user load sample clause databases
add helpful error messages about incorrect input
sally optimize rec_path


Sally to do:
-test!!!
-check uip alg

Julia to do:
-(maybe) make graph database state section look nicer
- propagation button
-maybe don't hide graph when solution is unsat?
-Would it be hard to color the recent decision point if I sent it to you? Not a huge deal but may help
explain how to choose a UIP. I included it in conflict_info ("recent_decision") in case its easy to do, but if its not then
ignore this!!
-exps are implemented on my end - sent as "exp" but only when finished = False!!!
  - need to add rewind and propagate
  - I combined rewind with conflict clause, so you only need to add propogate. If you want, we can combine that too!
- update explanations to account for showing them after


***FIRST check for conflict and display
***THEN check for finished - b/c if finished is true and conflict is true, must display conflict first
