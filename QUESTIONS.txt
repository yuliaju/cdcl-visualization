IF TIME
let user load sample clause databases
show which clauses are satisfied (already implemented in backend!)
add helpful educational tidbits
add helpful error messages about incorrect input
allow users to add unconsecutive p numbers



Sally to do:
test!!!
test backtrack level

Julia to do:
(maybe) make graph database state section look nicer
refactor ts
graph - node layout
graph - display the cut


QUESTIONS
how do you want me to send a list of satisfied clauses?
-- J: would it be possible to send two lists, one with a string (?) of each clause ["p1 or p2", "p3 or ~p4"]
-- (i'm not sure how you store it in the backend, just send me what's convenient) and another with corresponding
-- indices of booleans, where true means that clause is satisfied [true, false]

I added another example db to outline.txt (the one from pset1) for testing. It reaches the conflict correctly, but
I can't get it to transition from the conflict box back to asking the user for decisions. Will you take a look?

-- J: error when the clause database is just 'p1' (finishes but returns satisfied: false)

NOTES:
Additional piece of data called "parser" sent back the first time. False if incorrect input
Additional piece of data: if finished = True, satisfied = true or false
