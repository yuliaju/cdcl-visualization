QUESTIONS/NOTES:
1) right now I am sending you only new nodes and edges. This is more efficient (you don't have to regenerate the graph every time, just use the api to create the new nodes). But would you rather I send all?

2) I realized that when there is a conflict, I need to send you {level, nodes, edges, decided} at the conflict AND once everything has been reset. I added data["reset"], included only when conflict is true. It contains:

level
decided
edges: ALL edges in new (reset) graph, same format
nodes: ALL nodes in new (reset) graph, same format

THOUGHTS FOR LATER
user should not be able to modify clause db during alg OR if they do, alg restarts




IF TIME
let user load sample clause databases
show which clauses are satisfied (already implemented in backend!
add helpful educational tidbits
