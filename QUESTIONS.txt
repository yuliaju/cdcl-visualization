TESTING TO DOS
what happens when...
	aftermath of 2 simultaneous conflicts - I think this works now!



Sally to do:
test!!!
check uip alg

Julia to do:
(maybe) make graph database state section look nicer
refactor ts
conflict bar doesn't disappear when regenerating db during other conflict
maybe don't hide graph when solution is unsat?


***FIRST check for conflict and display
***THEN check for finished - b/c if finished is true and conflict is true, must display conflict first
