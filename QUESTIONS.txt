THOUGHTS FOR LATER
user should not be able to modify clause db during alg OR if they do, alg restarts
--I think it's fine if the alg restarts if they modify the clause db; that should be a familiar UX
***--OK sounds good. So I've made it so the alg restarts, but you'll need to clear the graph nodes if they press it


IF TIME
let user load sample clause databases
show which clauses are satisfied (already implemented in backend!)
add helpful educational tidbits



Sally to do:
parse clauses
return unsat
test!!!

send list of satisfied clauses
