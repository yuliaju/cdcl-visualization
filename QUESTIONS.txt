let user load sample clause databases
add helpful error messages about incorrect input
propogation button
sally optimize rec_path



Sally to do:
-test!!!
-check uip alg

Julia to do:
-(maybe) make graph database state section look nicer
-refactor ts
-conflict bar doesn't disappear when regenerating db during other conflict
-maybe don't hide graph when solution is unsat?
-Yellow arrow colors identifying the cut are a bit off: The highlight edges coming out of ALL uips. We 
want all paths coming out of the correct UIP only (in out examples: 4->2, 2->3, 3->K, 4->K)
-Would it be hard to color the recent decision point if I sent it to you? Not a huge deal but may help 
explain how to choose a UIP. I included it in conflict_info in case its easy to do, but if its not then
ignore this!!


***FIRST check for conflict and display
***THEN check for finished - b/c if finished is true and conflict is true, must display conflict first
