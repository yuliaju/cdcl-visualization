IF TIME
let user load sample clause databases
show which clauses are satisfied (already implemented in backend!)
add helpful educational tidbits
add helpful error messages about incorrect input
allow users to add unconsecutive p numbers



Sally to do:
return unsat
test!!!
backtrack level is SECOND HIGHEST level (so if only one to choose from, ans is 0)

Julia to do:
reset graph when "generate database" is pressed



QUESTIONS
how do you want me to send a list of satisfied clauses?
I added another example db to outline.txt (the one from pset1) for testing. It reaches the conflict correctly, but
I can't get it to transition from the conflict box back to asking the user for decisions. Will you take a look?

NOTES:
Additional piece of data called "parser" sent back the first time. False if incorrect input
